I will tell you something interesting about this place. In the past, from here to here, it was all Syrian, ok? And then, Turkey took some of it so the new map is like this. I\u2019m not sure where it is, but it\u2019s this big. Iskenderun was for Syrian. My grandfather and my grandmother were born in Kilis. So, the thing is after the lines were taken, my grandmother and my grandfather from my mother\u2019s side are now Turkish, but we don\u2019t have anything to prove it, so I\u2019m supposed to be a Turkish citizen if my grandfather got papers and everything but he couldn\u2019t, I mean he died years ago. So, this is information maybe you don\u2019t need it. But some Syrians, in my case, did something very interesting, they took out the papers to prove that they are Turkish and then they applied to the Turkish government and they took citizenship, during the last 2, 3 years, they did this. So now, they have the full right of a Turkish citizen. Many people in the same as my situation, their fathers or their sisters were born in this land, you see this land here, and they just forgot all about it and now when the war started, they need a new place to go and since they have this proof, they could get another nationality passport. Once you get Turkish citizenship, you can buy properties, you can study like a citizen. Inside the city, and when we left, we had to go north to Azaz, I\u2019m not sure which road we took but it was a long way, it\u2019s not direct, we had to do some circles, it wasn\u2019t direct because we were told that it was dangerous, and there was bombardment and stuff so we stayed like more than 1 hour and 45 minutes on the road to Azaz by minivan. We were supposed to go in 20 minutes, but it took us 1 hour and more. It wasn\u2019t expensive, I mean it\u2019s a local transportation. It wasn\u2019t even official like those vans are owned by someone who decide to be a hero \u201chey, come on!\u201d. Because this is the only way and there is a checkpoint, there is the border gate from Azaz, its name is Al-Salameh, we went out from Al-Salameh, on my passport, this stamp is Al-Salameh gate, here it\u2019s not translated in English. So, you see, it says Turkey like Al-Salameh, the checkpoint to enter Turkey. Of course, there are two or three gates but this was the nearest one. There is one from al-Rai, another checkpoint. In the past, I used to go from al-Rai but last time, we went from Al-Salameh. We used to visit my sister in Turkey. You should know something that this area, Azaz, at that time, the opposition army took over, this means this place was not an official checkpoint, when I say official, I mean related to the government, the Assad regime, so this place didn\u2019t belong by that time to the government, and we went out by an unofficial way. This means, on my passport, there is no stamp from the government that says \u201cNooda left officially\u201d but I have a stamp that says \u201cthe opposition management approves\u201d they stamped it because they dominated this part and I believe till now, it\u2019s still under their control. We stopped in Azaz and we changed the car. It was a cab, a yellow cab and we paid the driver, he took us not only to the border but also to the airport of Gaziantep. We went to Kilis, this is like 10 minutes from here to here and then we went to Gaziantep. Before I should tell you something the Turkish border approved the passport officially, as the government approved it and everything, we entered, and there was no problem at all because Turkey was in cooperation with the opposition army. Then we drove to Gaziantep. So, we drove all the way for half an hour to the border. There is an airport there. It\u2019s famous, it is not big but it\u2019s very useful. Then we stayed at the airport. I\u2019m trying to locate the airport. So, we didn\u2019t enter the city because I remember that we went fast. The taxi went his way, we paid him and everything and then we entered the airport and we stayed 24 hours, we slept 1 night because our place was the next day, and we have no one in the city, so we stayed there a night. We saw others Syrians. It was full. I even saw my friend and her family who were leaving also for Russia from Gaziantep. Because Gaziantep airport is connected to many cities all around the world. The airplane came and we moved to Istanbul because there is no direct flight to Sarajevo. We took the flight to Istanbul. In Istanbul, there are two airports, we used the big one called Atat\u00fcrk. Inside the airport, we moved from the domestic section to the international section to take a flight and fly internationally to Sarajevo. We had everything booked and prepared. Before we take the flight, it\u2019s an important part that I forgot to tell you about the visa. The visa is in Istanbul, the embassy is in Istanbul, we went to the Bosnian embassy, and we applied for forms and everything. We wrote that we were invited by a Bosnian citizen which was the wife of my brother. Then we wrote that, from her side, she did some papers, and she sent some guarantees, I don\u2019t know if these things work but they accepted us, I entered there and I told them Aymen Arida invites me, and I showed him my passport and my mum\u2019s passport. So, he filled the paper and then he told us to come the next day but we cannot come the next day because our plane is on the same day, so we were like \u201cplease finish it today\u201d and he was like \u201cok\u201d, then we went for lunch, and came back to him and it was ready. It was ready and after three phone calls to tell him \u201cPlease we have a plane waiting\u201d. Then we took it and we went to the airport in the evening. At the airport, he took us to his house, right away from Sarajevo airport. We came by car; he lives here like 10 minutes from Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija. I even know the street because I lived there for 8 months. He lives in Nerkesijina. Probably this is his house. Then I left, me and mum, we rent a house in Alipa\u0161ino polje. They helped and there was a website where you can find houses. I stayed there for 8 months, or less than a year. The owner came to us and said \u201cwe need the hours\u201d. \u201cOk, how much time do we have?\u201d. He said like 2 months. I started to look for another and I found this one and we moved to Ned\u017eari\u0107i. This is my street because this street is in front of my building. We left Syria on August 11, 2013. It was Saturday. In Turkey, we stayed at my sister\u2019s place and we spent 3 months. From Gaziantep, we went to Izmir. So, the plan was Gaziantep, and then we went to Izmir, Adnan Menderes is the name of the airport. We found my sister and her husband and they took us for a drive to a city called \u00d6demi\u015f, which is a big district of Izmir. They live there and we lived with them for 3 months, I mean we were planning to stay more but the visa ended, I mean the time that allowed for Syrians to stay in Turkey, it\u2019s 3 months without a visa. Then either they must buy residency or they must leave and come back again. You know they must leave and then get their passport stamped and then come back. Since our neighbourhood was under bombardment, we couldn\u2019t go back to Aleppo, so we needed a place to go. This is where the wife of my brother prepared the papers and everything. That\u2019s why we left. We were planning and we were wishing that the war will end soon and we were waiting. It never happened so first we discussed the possibility that we buy residency, and they ask for too much money like 1000 liras to depose it, and to put it as a deposit in a bank for each person, and we couldn\u2019t have this amount of money so we left. We went to Izmir, we drive back to Izmir, and from Izmir to Istanbul by plane, to do the visa. We went to the embassy; we did the visa and everything and you know the rest of the story. We fly to Sarajevo. The thing is some people decided to stay in Turkey without anything, they just broke, their house was destroyed then they had no place. After that, a new law appeared in Turkey and say that \u201cit\u2019s ok for Syrian people to stay in Turkey without residency without them paying, they are allowed to live for how long as they want\u201d, shortly after we left. They told the husband of my sister that each day, they stay after their visa is ended, they must pay like 60 liras as tax. We didn\u2019t have the money. He was scared because they will come to him and ask him to pay. After all, he is the guarantee, he is the one hosting us in his house, and we didn\u2019t want to bother him with all of this. So, it was better to leave. We stayed at his place for 3 months, during these 3 months, we applied for asylum, my brother did it, but I went for an interview. The first interview, there was an official from the Ministry of Security. Her name was Harisa. She was the translator before. His name is Moris. I don\u2019t remember the place but it was far, maybe it is called Rakovica. It has a gate. You enter and then just you walk up to the right. We saw a lot of dogs. It was winter, snowing. We did the interview there, and we got this card, a yellow card, it was called Asylum seeker card or something like this. I have it if you want to copy it. I could have brought everything. Maybe I can take pictures with my mobile because it has all the dates and all the data. For the second interview, first me and my mother sit in the same place with those three officials and they take all the information about us, name, surname, ages, jobs, our city, where we lived, when, where, all these information, my job, mum\u2019s job, sisters and brothers, like everything. Then they interviewed us alone and they take the story like why we left, when, and how do we feel about it, and why Bosnia and which city we navigated until we reached here, just like what we are talking about and a lot of questions, maybe the most important one was \u201care you planning to go back?\u201d and mum was like \u201cOf course! Of course! My home! My country!\u201d. Then the same questions for me, of course, we told the same story because we were not lying about what happened. After 3 months, there is another interview and this one was quick. It was like confirmation of everything, it was like 30 minutes for me and mum. They were so cooperative and kind, we told them \u201cMy mum cannot wait\u201d and they cut it short. After that, we waited quite a few months, and then the decision was made that we are not going to take refugees status, it failed, this procedure failed, but we succeeded to take protection. Then they issued this white card, I have this one because I always hold it, it\u2019s my identification. I don\u2019t go anywhere without it and this one is renewed every year. So, when we renew it, we give them the old one and we take the new one. Yes of course they always ask \u201care you still at the same address?\u201d, it\u2019s very important for them to know. Alma, I see her, I went there alone. Do you know this huge building of glasses in front of ALTA? Yeah, I went there. I had to see the manager there, her name is Liliana and I wanted to ask her some questions about my passport. Because my passport expired, and the embassy will not renew it because for them I\u2019m a traitor because I left unofficially. So yeah, I went to ask and I also asked some questions about the future of my staying, I mean I\u2019m staying here but I don\u2019t have residency, I don\u2019t have anything so what\u2019s next, and more questions about activities here, integration into society. I saw her once. The workshop that one organization offers us its office, it\u2019s in Avaz Twist Tower. Here is the workshop. Let me google it. Here is the organization\u2019s website and it has an English version. It used to work, but for the article, the translation is good and updated as well. So, you can check it out later anyway. I will show you the woman whom I work with. Oh, I am even on the website! Yes, this is the workshop we did. This is my art teacher, me and this is Marijana. Her name is Marijana. She is the chef executor, executor manager, another employee. I did the photography and I upload it here. I met this guy at this exhibition. Yeah, the diplomatic was there. In Skenderija, there is a big hall. Marijana is the chef executor and executor manager of this organization. As you can see, here are the donors and partners. When we first came here, mum used to do sessions with one of the psychiatrists, mum was sad and she wanted someone to talk to, she needed some psychological help, just someone to share her sadness. So, they visit us a couple of times, and she came to their office. They were supportive. They tried to help as much as possible but it\u2019s always the problem of donations, money, and stuff because there are limited and they cannot exceed it. Like we didn\u2019t have a choice, if my sister was not in \u00d6demi\u015f, we would never visit \u00d6demi\u015f, and if my brother was not in Sarajevo, probably this is the last country we think about. Everybody knows that Bosnia just finished the war and economically they are dead. Because my brother is here, we had to come here. We had no choice. So, this was the place available for us, we just acted. We have no one in Turkey. So, Syrians, unfortunately, don\u2019t have a place, they just sleep on the streets. We navigated officially by plane, with passports and everything. But others don\u2019t have a passport, and they need to go to a country that doesn\u2019t give visas, so they get themselves smuggled, and it\u2019s insane. They cross the sea. They get drown. It\u2019s horrible. The navigation, plane, and all the tickets. Our plane tickets from Gaziantep to Izmir were paid by my sister, and then tickets from Izmir to Sarajevo were paid by my brother. My work on the Internet was not enough. But later on, I managed to get my new manager and the pay was good enough. When it increased, I left my brother\u2019s house and I rent it on my own. At that time, I was working on my own but the pay was not too much, it was just pocket money. It was my old boss, I mean the Syrian one, the one who introduced me to this guy in Kuwait. My sister always helps, she sends money, she paid us for tickets, she sent us clothes, the jacket, many things, she sends a packet of 10 kilos and I go to the post office. I have all the papers. If you would have told me, we would have made it precisely and accurately. I have the report that when we did the interview. Everything we said in the interview. It was written and it was included in the decision said that we have humanitarian protection. But it\u2019s all in Bosnia. But I think this information is confidential. I\u2019m not sure if I can give it to you or if you can use it freely. We didn\u2019t give it to employees in other places here, because my lawyer said: \u201cdon\u2019t give it to anyone, it\u2019s confidential\u201d. It\u2019s like a secret. It\u2019s like confirmation of everything I said.", "gt_entities": [[0, 0, "Q41183", "wiki", 5, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 165, 6], [0, 0, "Q174341", "wiki", 262, 10], [0, 0, "Q206881", "wiki", 336, 5], [0, 0, "Q277674", "wiki", 1402, 4], [0, 0, "Q277674", "wiki", 1669, 4], [0, 0, "Q277674", "wiki", 2001, 4], [0, 0, "Q12188445", "wiki", 2019, 10], [0, 0, "Q12188445", "wiki", 2048, 10], [0, 0, "Q12188445", "wiki", 2090, 10], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 2165, 6], [0, 0, "Q12188445", "wiki", 2177, 10], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 2213, 6], [0, 0, "Q12187629", "wiki", 2309, 6], [0, 0, "Q12187629", "wiki", 2368, 6], [0, 0, "Q12188445", "wiki", 2403, 10], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 2445, 6], [0, 0, "Q277674", "wiki", 2495, 4], [0, 0, "Q277674", "wiki", 3056, 4], [0, 0, "Q93338", "wiki", 3197, 9], [0, 0, "Q206881", "wiki", 3219, 5], [0, 0, "Q93338", "wiki", 3288, 9], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 3485, 6], [0, 0, "Q93338", "wiki", 3554, 9], [0, 0, "Q159", "wiki", 4147, 6], [0, 0, "Q93338", "wiki", 4159, 9], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 4280, 8], [0, 0, "Q11194", "wiki", 4326, 8], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 4358, 8], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 4371, 8], [0, 0, "Q86473", "wiki", 4432, 7], [0, 0, "Q11194", "wiki", 4569, 8], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 4725, 8], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 4753, 8], [0, 0, "Q629641", "wiki", 5704, 10], [0, 0, "None", "wiki", 5787, 11], [0, 0, "Q3436419", "wiki", 5872, 15], [0, 0, "Q3930073", "wiki", 6176, 9], [0, 0, "Q858", "wiki", 6261, 5], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 6307, 6], [0, 0, "Q93338", "wiki", 6374, 9], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 6396, 5], [0, 0, "Q93338", "wiki", 6420, 9], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 6451, 5], [0, 0, "Q293927", "wiki", 6582, 6], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 6617, 5], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 6786, 6], [0, 0, "Q41183", "wiki", 7051, 6], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 7525, 5], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 7549, 5], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 7565, 5], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 7574, 8], [0, 0, "Q11194", "wiki", 7710, 8], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 7764, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 7890, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 7948, 6], [0, 0, "Q3057155", "wiki", 8771, 8], [0, 0, "Q225", "wiki", 9574, 6], [0, 0, "Q790278", "wiki", 11382, 16], [0, 0, "Q1280411", "wiki", 11983, 10], [0, 0, "Q293927", "wiki", 12631, 6], [0, 0, "Q293927", "wiki", 12660, 6], [0, 0, "Q11194", "wiki", 12697, 8], [0, 0, "Q225", "wiki", 12778, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 12980, 6], [0, 0, "Q93338", "wiki", 13393, 9], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 13406, 5], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 13458, 5], [0, 0, "Q11194", "wiki", 13467, 8], [0, 0, "Q817", "wiki", 13864, 6], [0, 0, "Q225", "wiki", 14339, 6]]}
{"document_id": "**** *recit_03 *sex_masculin *age_9999 *pays_Somalie *status_celibataire *prenom_Salman", "original_text": "I was born in Saudi Arabia. A city name Jeddah. It is not the capital city. In 1982, August 21, the time when I started school, I went back to Somalia with my family. My parents were working there. When the contract is finished, you must go back to Somalia. If I was born in France, maybe they give me the nationality, but not in Saudi Arabia. In all Arabic countries, they don\u2019t. So, I came back with my family to Somalia. I finished high school in Somalia and I have been accepted to some universities in Malaysia. I started with engineering. I didn\u2019t finish and I came back to Somalia. Then, I started a university in Somalia. I started business tourism. I have a certificate. I started working. I stayed in Somalia, but sometimes I go for a long time to Iraq, Egypt, and Dubai. I am going for tourism because my office has contact with some hotels. When people attacked me, I left my country. I left for Turkey because they took my passport. I left in 2012. In March, my son was born and then I left. I stayed there for two months. Then I went to Addis-Ababa by car. I went illegally because they took my passport. Then, I went to Sudan because I understand the Arabic language and my face looks like the Sudanese people. At that time, I did not go anywhere, I left my country. I thought to go to Kenya, but at that time there was Al-Shabaab at the border. So, I went to Ethiopia, Addis-Ababa alone. I stayed for two months. Ethiopia was very poor. For this, I don\u2019t like to stay in Ethiopia. Ethiopian is racist toward Somalian. So, Somalian don\u2019t like Ethiopian. I left Ethiopia and went to Sudan. There are a lot of people from Somalia. You stay there when you look like Somalian, and you need an apartment, he talks with you. I stayed for 2 months and after that, somebody told me there is a smuggler, if you need to go Sudan, we can go. I told him OK; I was going to Sudan. It costed 200 dollars and I could go inside Sudan without any problem. Other people from Ethiopia and Somalia, we went to Sudan. They were going to Libya but I didn\u2019t need to go to Libya. I stayed in Khartoum, the capital city and after that, I went to Port Sudan, it\u2019s near the sea. I stayed there for 2 months; and after that, somebody tell me there is a smuggler there and you can go to Syria. If I find a job there, it\u2019s good for me, but I don\u2019t have any documents, this is a problem for me. I can go into the city, wherever I want. I told him, I need to go to Syria, and he told me I have some smugglers, I can make for you some documents, after that, you can go to Syria with the ship. I stayed there for two months and a half. I talked with the smuggler, I told him \u201cI am coming for you\u201d and he said, \u201cyou come\u201d. I stayed in his home. He made for me a passport from Sudan. I came to Syria with a passport. When I came to Syria, I gave this passport to the smuggler. I came there by ship. I know some cousins who are in Syria. My brother\u2019s wife and children were staying there, my brother is dead. When I came there, I went to their home in Latakia. I am sorry, I am talking to you in the Arabic language! Then, I went to Aleppo and I stayed with my brother\u2019s wife. My brother is dead in Somalia. I stay with her. She said \u201cI must go now, there is too much war\u201d. I told her \u201cOk you can go\u201d. She went to Damascus. After that, I took a smuggler, he is from Kurdish Syrian, I talked with him, and I told him I need to cross the border of Turkey. He told me OK. I gave him some money like 400 dollars. After that, I crossed the border because when I came there, I didn\u2019t have any documents. The Syrian police caught me and told me \u201cYou are a terrorist\u201d or maybe he killed me. But I talked with some people, Kurdish Syrian, and I think he has some places, some cousins, near the border of Turkey. I went to his home; I gave him 400 dollars. When I crossed the border, I came to Turkey. I came to Antakya. I went to the bus station, he has some cousins in Turkey and he drove me to the bus station, he got a ticket for me and he sent me to Istanbul. I think I stayed in Istanbul for 1 year and a half. In October, 2015, I moved to Greece. I talked with some people I know; he is my friend and he is from Somalia. He is a student now in Istanbul. I found a job in Ankara. In Turkey, police don\u2019t attack black people, they don\u2019t make any problems with black people. I stayed in Turkey for a long time. I never saw a policeman telling me \u201cGive me your papers\u201d. Sometimes, I meet with him for some coffee, I talk with him, and he tells me \u201cYou are from where\u201d, I say \u201cI am from Somalia\u201d, he said \u201cgood people\u201d. They give me money and supports, but then I worked with a printer machine. I am working on that maybe for a long time. When I came, I had some money before. At this time, I just needed to have a job, I didn\u2019t need money. After that, I was too much tired of Turkey, and someone told me \u201cWhy you don\u2019t cross and go to find something in Europe?\u201d. I told him \u201cOk, I come with you\u201d. I know one person, who left Turkey, he went to Greece, and after that, he found someone from Sudan, I left Turkey and I came to Greece. I stayed a bit because in Istanbul, there are too many smugglers not like in Ankara. I talked with a smuggler, he was Turkish, and some Arabic people. I talked with him; he told me \u201cGo to Izmir\u201d. I went to Izmir. He makes some contact with smugglers in Izmir. I brought the money from Istanbul with my friend. I said when I crossed and I moved to Greece, you can give him the money. He is a student yes. I stayed in Izmir for 5 days with the smuggler. It is like a pension. There are too many people from everywhere like African, Syrian people, Iraqi people\u2026 I came to a port with forty people in a big boat. When I came to Greece, they gave me a paper for 1 month, from the Greek government. They gave me a paper that I must leave Greece after 1 month. I stayed in Thessaloniki for 2 days in closed camp. Then, I went outside and I went to Athens with Somalian people. I met them and I gave them 50 euros for a month and for every week, I give 15 or maybe 20 euros for food. Because my paper is finished, the police catch me, and they put me in some closed camp for 6 months in Athens. The closed camp is very bad, it is like a prison. There were too many people from Albania, from Morocco. Every day, they fight but I don\u2019t fight. I fight 1 day with a guy from Cameroon. I don\u2019t know, he attacked me two times or three times, and I don\u2019t like to make a fight. When the 6 months are finished, they gave you the paper for 6 months and after 6 months, you must leave Greece. I went out of the camp but I stayed in Athens with other Somalian people for 1 year. They gave me a paper for 6 months, this time I am not afraid of the police, it\u2019s ok, when the police catch me, I give them paper. When the 6 months finished, I stayed 1 year and a half. I came there on the 13 of January. The big problem for me was when I stayed in Greece for 6 months in jail and 6 months with the paper and then I left. I looked for some smugglers. I stayed with some people, I think 17 or 18 from Syria and Iraq. I know the driver because I saw him when I talked with the smuggler. He told me \u201cGo with this car, he is the driver\u201d. I told him \u201cOk\u201d. I paid 1500 euros, and that\u2019s how I came to Serbia near Belgrade. I think it is 10 kilometers from Belgrade. When I walked, I saw some buses, I went to the bus station. After that, at the bus station, I say \u201cI need to go to a camp in Bogova\u0111a\u201d. I listened to some people, some of my friends, they said \u201cwhen you come there, ask for a camp\u201d. I know this camp. When I came to Bogova\u0111a, they gave me the paper and they told me \u201cGo to Banja\u201d. I paid for a taxi to go there directly for 65 euros. He asked me for 80 euros, I said \u201cno it\u2019s too much\u201d, I said \u201c70\u201d, ok \u201c65\u201d. He told me how is the situation in the camp, that I must clean, and do like this, and not making any problems, and \u201cyou don\u2019t drink inside\u201d. I told him \u201cOk\u201d. They give me an ID card for 6 months and I can move. I think they stay with the smuggler. They are in the camp, but he is ready, he needed to go, he made contact with the smuggler, the smuggler told him \u201cCome\u201d, he stayed in some places, when the car is ready, he went with the car. If he stayed with the smuggler, he didn\u2019t need to be in the camp. My friend when he came to Greece, he told me \u201cYou can stay in a camp in Bogova\u0111a\u201d, but they said that Bogova\u0111a is very bad. You must cut your hair, the people who sleep there, told me \u201cYou must do it\u201d. I told them \u201cWhy? This is my choice, if I like it, I make it, if I don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t do it\u201d. I think he is a military. Those people are refugees and are not from the army! The people told me that it\u2019s a good camp. So, I came there. It\u2019s very good here and it\u2019s a nice place. Sometimes, I went to Loznica by taxi, when I need something or I went to some restaurants sometimes. They are good people there and some people, sometimes, when they meet you, they say \u201cexcuse me, can I take a picture with you?\u201d When it was winter, I was with some friends from Morocco; they left the camp now I don\u2019t know where they go. He wanted to go to Loznica. He told me \u201cYou know where is Loznica?\u201d. I told him yes. They tell me \u201cCome with me\u201d. When I have been there, too many ladies came with me, \u201ccan we have one picture?\u201d. You have breakfast but if I want to wake up for breakfast, I can wake up, but sometimes, I don\u2019t care about breakfast, and I sleep. From 8:30 to 9:30, there is no breakfast. If I need breakfast, maybe I wake up. I wake up at noon maybe, 11, 12 o\u2019clock and this time and I come for lunch, I eat from 12:30 to 13:30. The last dinner is from 6:30 to 7:30. Sometimes I eat, and sometimes I don\u2019t care about any food. I go to the supermarket, I buy some things, and I cook. When my smoke is finished, I go to the market. Yes, she is my friend. I give her the name: Margarita. When she sees me, she says \u201cCiao Margarita\u201d, and I say \u201cCiao Margarita\u201d. She is good. But when I\u2019m coming, I had one problem. Some thieves took my mobile. If he is still here, I must fight with him. I ask my friends for a mobile, a Galaxy 5 as I don\u2019t like iPhone. Before he comes, he said, \u201cmy friend, I need to contact my family\u201d. I gave him some time when he contacts me when he finishes, he gives me. And one day, I don\u2019t sleep for the whole night, I woke up for the whole night, so that time I\u2019m sleeping maybe after breakfast like 10 o\u2019clock like that. When I sleep, he comes to me and says \u201cI need to contact with my family\u201d. I told him \u201cI put in charge, take with the charge, when you finish, give me, I don\u2019t wake up today, I need to sleep\u201d. He tells me \u201cOk\u201d. I wake up maybe at 3 o\u2019clock. When I wake up, he doesn\u2019t sleep. I ask some people, he left, he doesn\u2019t talk with anybody, he takes my mobile. Another man he knows at that time that he left, and he didn\u2019t tell me. Another Algerian name Samir, he knew he left, he knew he took my mobile, but he doesn\u2019t talk to me. Algerian people are thieves. It\u2019s the only problem with the racists. When I stayed in Greece, I hate myself, every day I am drinking. Because when I stay in Greece, I have my wife and for this time, I became crazy. I don\u2019t have contact with any people. I sleep, wake up, and I go to some bars, and I drink, I go back, I sleep, I wake up. I don\u2019t have care for food or anything. After that, I remember something, I stopped with a drink after that, I must go, I leave this country, if I stay maybe I will die. That\u2019s somebody, he came and he talked to me too much, he said \u201cwhy do you do this like this, you are Muslim\u201d. I accept this. Every day I remember what can I do. It\u2019s very different. You can see here, I don\u2019t have any job or anything, only somebody sends me money, like some cousins and some friends. I finish my money. Every day I smoke. I don\u2019t have a job. For this reason, I leave this country. But it\u2019s a safe country, I just worry about the work and the money. When I arrived, I stayed in Turkey, I have a friend, he lived in Turkey and he went to Europe, he took a passport, after that, he came back for me. He told me \u201cWhy do you stay there? Go! Find some passport\u201d. I accept it. I don\u2019t like Greece because when I stay there, they made many problems for myself and my country, so I don\u2019t like it. It is not only racism. When I came to Greece, it is very poor, there is a job but not too many jobs, only, police came for me when he put me in jail and closed camp, I hate Greece for this experience. When I go for anyway, I remember Greece. Maybe if I have a long time, I see my children, and I will tell this history. For Hungary, if they take my fingerprints, it\u2019s problem. I don\u2019t like Hungary neither. For Croatia, I think the smuggler doesn\u2019t have contact with Croatian people, the smugglers know Hungarian people. Then, the Croatian people, when they catch you or when you cross the border, they send you to jail for 6 months. They are very racist. About this, I didn\u2019t try Croatia. There is no jail. Only he takes your fingerprints, after that you can go. He gives you the choice: if you need fingerprints or you don\u2019t need them, then he let you go or maybe he gives you status. For Somalian, he gives status. I like England but England is very far. I want to go to Germany. First, I must go to France. One time, I come to the border with Bulgaria. When I stay in Greece, some smuggler told me \u201cYou can go to Bulgaria and Serbia\u201d. Because at that time, I came to Serbia from Macedonia, police caught me and deport me. After that, I tried again another time. He caught me, he deported me. I came near Bulgaria, I came inside Bulgaria, and Bulgarian police caught me. After that, I came to Serbia. Some smuggler told me \u201cWhen you go, go to this place, it\u2019s a safe place\u201d. Bulgarian police are very problematic to you. For Greece, I tried one time only. When the police catch you, he fights and after that he deports you. I went there by car. He took me to the border. In Athens, I contact some smugglers, he told me that he has a road to Bulgaria. He understands that Bulgarian police don\u2019t catch him. After that, I left from the car, I crossed some places, after that, another car was waiting for me there just after the border. When I came inside the car, maybe this car is working for 15 minutes and the police came. He caught the driver, and he caught the people. \u201cCome down\u201d. When we came down, he fought all the people as I remembered, a friend from Sudan, when he fought him, he told him in Arabic \u201cmother fucker\u201d. I think there are 30 people. First, they asked \u201cFrom Turkey?\u201d, I said, \u201cno from Greece\u201d, and he deported me. I called the smuggler and I said: \u201cThis plan is finished\u201d. I found another car. I came near the train station. I took the ticket with the train and I went back to Athens. I remembered my friend\u2019s fight, that time I was very angry because I drank too much alcohol. When the police pushed me, I talked with him in English, some bullshit, he came and he fought with me too much, \u201cdon\u2019t talk and sit\u201d. When I remembered this, I laughed too much. Some families of Syrians, they didn\u2019t care about anything. Bulgarian people are mafia. I have a friend, he talked with me about his country, the polices are mafia, the government is the mafia, all people are mafia from Bulgaria, I am too much afraid of Bulgaria.", "gt_entities": [[0, 0, "Q851", "wiki", 14, 12], [0, 0, "Q374365", "wiki", 40, 6], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 143, 7], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 249, 7], [0, 0, "Q142", "wiki", 275, 6], [0, 0, "Q851", "wiki", 330, 12], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 415, 7], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 450, 7], [0, 0, "Q833", "wiki", 507, 8], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 580, 7], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 621, 7], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 711, 7], [0, 0, "Q796", "wiki", 758, 4], [0, 0, "Q79", "wiki", 764, 5], [0, 0, "Q612", "wiki", 775, 5], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 908, 6], [0, 0, "Q3624", "wiki", 1051, 11], [0, 0, "Q1049", "wiki", 1135, 5], [0, 0, "Q114", "wiki", 1301, 5], [0, 0, "Q115", "wiki", 1375, 8], [0, 0, "Q3624", "wiki", 1385, 11], [0, 0, "Q115", "wiki", 1429, 8], [0, 0, "Q115", "wiki", 1487, 8], [0, 0, "Q115", "wiki", 1576, 8], [0, 0, "Q1049", "wiki", 1597, 5], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 1635, 7], [0, 0, "Q1049", "wiki", 1828, 5], [0, 0, "Q1049", "wiki", 1876, 5], [0, 0, "Q1049", "wiki", 1927, 5], [0, 0, "Q115", "wiki", 1972, 8], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 1985, 7], [0, 0, "Q1049", "wiki", 2005, 5], [0, 0, "Q1016", "wiki", 2031, 5], [0, 0, "Q1016", "wiki", 2064, 5], [0, 0, "Q1963", "wiki", 2083, 8], [0, 0, "Q208718", "wiki", 2136, 10], [0, 0, "Q858", "wiki", 2273, 5], [0, 0, "Q858", "wiki", 2448, 5], [0, 0, "Q858", "wiki", 2554, 5], [0, 0, "Q1049", "wiki", 2756, 5], [0, 0, "Q858", "wiki", 2773, 5], [0, 0, "Q858", "wiki", 2811, 5], [0, 0, "Q858", "wiki", 2909, 5], [0, 0, "Q200030", "wiki", 3030, 7], [0, 0, "Q41183", "wiki", 3111, 6], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 3177, 7], [0, 0, "Q3766", "wiki", 3292, 8], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 3424, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 3773, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 3862, 6], [0, 0, "Q80561", "wiki", 3880, 7], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 3939, 6], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 4023, 8], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 4053, 8], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 4114, 6], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 4187, 7], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 4219, 8], [0, 0, "Q3640", "wiki", 4246, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 4257, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 4359, 6], [0, 0, "Q1045", "wiki", 4557, 7], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 4847, 6], [0, 0, "Q46", "wiki", 4924, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 4996, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 5015, 6], [0, 0, "Q1049", "wiki", 5061, 5], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 5075, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 5096, 6], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 5130, 8], [0, 0, "Q3640", "wiki", 5181, 6], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 5292, 5], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 5310, 5], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 5357, 5], [0, 0, "Q406", "wiki", 5389, 8], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 5451, 6], [0, 0, "Q35997", "wiki", 5520, 5], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 5728, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 5836, 6], [0, 0, "Q17151", "wiki", 5870, 12], [0, 0, "Q1524", "wiki", 5945, 6], [0, 0, "Q1524", "wiki", 6183, 6], [0, 0, "Q222", "wiki", 6273, 7], [0, 0, "Q1028", "wiki", 6287, 7], [0, 0, "Q1009", "wiki", 6367, 8], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 6570, 6], [0, 0, "Q1524", "wiki", 6617, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 6928, 6], [0, 0, "Q858", "wiki", 7079, 5], [0, 0, "Q796", "wiki", 7089, 4], [0, 0, "Q403", "wiki", 7274, 6], [0, 0, "Q3711", "wiki", 7286, 8], [0, 0, "Q3711", "wiki", 7329, 8], [0, 0, "Q2221984", "wiki", 7464, 8], [0, 0, "Q2221984", "wiki", 7604, 8], [0, 0, "Q2545871", "wiki", 7661, 5], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 8329, 6], [0, 0, "Q2221984", "wiki", 8375, 8], [0, 0, "Q2221984", "wiki", 8405, 8], [0, 0, "Q648489", "wiki", 8806, 7], [0, 0, "Q1028", "wiki", 9063, 7], [0, 0, "Q648489", "wiki", 9142, 7], [0, 0, "Q648489", "wiki", 9181, 7], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 11058, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 11129, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 11974, 6], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 12011, 6], [0, 0, "Q46", "wiki", 12033, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 12180, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 12323, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 12458, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 12519, 6], [0, 0, "Q28", "wiki", 12609, 7], [0, 0, "Q28", "wiki", 12675, 7], [0, 0, "Q224", "wiki", 12696, 7], [0, 0, "Q224", "wiki", 12966, 7], [0, 0, "Q21", "wiki", 13210, 7], [0, 0, "Q21", "wiki", 13222, 7], [0, 0, "Q183", "wiki", 13259, 7], [0, 0, "Q142", "wiki", 13288, 6], [0, 0, "Q219", "wiki", 13332, 8], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 13357, 6], [0, 0, "Q219", "wiki", 13402, 8], [0, 0, "Q403", "wiki", 13415, 6], [0, 0, "Q403", "wiki", 13456, 6], [0, 0, "Q221", "wiki", 13468, 9], [0, 0, "Q219", "wiki", 13593, 8], [0, 0, "Q219", "wiki", 13617, 8], [0, 0, "Q403", "wiki", 13681, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 13813, 6], [0, 0, "Q1524", "wiki", 13962, 6], [0, 0, "Q219", "wiki", 14029, 8], [0, 0, "Q1049", "wiki", 14447, 5], [0, 0, "Q43", "wiki", 14566, 6], [0, 0, "Q41", "wiki", 14593, 6], [0, 0, "Q1524", "wiki", 14785, 6], [0, 0, "Q219", "wiki", 15283, 8], [0, 0, "Q219", "wiki", 15317, 8]]}
